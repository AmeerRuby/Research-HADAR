Developing and optimize HADAR model :
Processing real-life data to develop device that can help cars drivers see
clearly in the night without light
Reducing number of bands processing in the model through machine
learning method, makes the project more practical
Succesfully optimize the model through Python, future plan will be
acquired real expensive sensor camera.
